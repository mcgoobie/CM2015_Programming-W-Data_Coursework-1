This project was meant for broadening my exposure to the Python programming language and using data visualization libraries such as
matplotlib, seaborn, pandas and other statistical libraries such as numpy.

The objective of this project was for me to apply data visualization techniques in Python to a field/area of interest. In this case,
the pricing trends of Computer Graphics Cards were chosen and how factors such as the coronavirus and cryptocurrency boom had affected it.
This study mainly focuses on the Nvidia Ampere series of Graphics Cards such as the RTX 3080 and takes a look at its features that made it
so highly sought after and the pricing trend over the course of 2021 - 2022.

This was coded in Jupyter Notebook and the detailed report can be found in the .ipynb file.
